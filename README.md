# remove-HTML
A small script that allows you to remove the .html extension from you static webpages.

`www.yourwebsite.com/index.html` :arrow_right: `www.yourwebsite.com/`

`www.yourwebsite.com/contact.html` :arrow_right: `www.yourwebsite.com/contact`

Furthermore, if a user visits a webpage without typing the .html extension (i.e. www.yourwebsite.com/projects), they will still be directed to the proper location (i.e. projects.html will still load).
