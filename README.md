# remove-HTML
A small script that allows you to remove the .html extension from you static webpages.

`www.yourwebsite.com/index.html` :arrow_right: `www.yourwebsite.com/`

`www.yourwebsite.com/contact.html` :arrow_right: `www.yourwebsite.com/contact`

Furthermore, if a user visits a webpage without typing the .html extension (i.e. [www.yourwebsite.com/projects](https://media.giphy.com/media/JIX9t2j0ZTN9S/giphy.gif)), they will still be directed to the proper location (i.e. projects.html will still load).
## how to use
Simply insert this code on any page that you would like the extension (.html) removed.
`<script type="text/javascript" src="link/to/removeHTML.js"></script>`
